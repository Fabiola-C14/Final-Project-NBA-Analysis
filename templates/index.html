                    The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate various NBA’s players, and determine which players are most likely to succeed or move to the next level in their careers. The first step was to identify the important factors that distinguish NBA legends from
                    the rest. We began by closely examining the characteristics of All Stars players, such as: points, wins, player’s impact estimate, usage player was involved in, prior All-Star games, and annual salary (adjusted for inflation and contractual
                    caps) . We also analyzed the player’s biometrics, and injuries to help us determine any potential correlation between their health and success, which was defined by the player's earnings. We then applied learnings from our analysis
                    to train different machine learning models to see how closely the models can predict a player's salary and expose the true value of players based on their performance against other similar players. Analysis of the dataset can provide
                    competitive insight to all teams.

                    <p>The NBA All-Star Game has always been a midseason showdown between the best players from each conference. The game has consistently showcased a copious amount of talent playing for their respective coast. What better place to explore
                        top talent and see what stats factor into the highest salaries.
                        <br>
                        <br> First, we wanted to see if there was a correlation between All-Star status and salary. The interactive scatter plot shows that all the top salaries each year were also All-Star players. We confirmed a strong case to use All-Star
                        achievement as a benchmark to train and test machine learning models to predict players' success.

                <h4>NBA Health BMI</h4>
                <p>
                    Body Mass Index is a good gauge of body fat. The most basic definition of overweight and obesity is having too much body fat-so much so that it “presents a risk to health.” A reliable way to determine whether a person has too much body fat is to calculate
                    the ratio of their weight to their height squared. This ratio, called the body mass index (BMI), accounts for the fact that taller people have more tissue than shorter people, and so they tend to weigh more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this analysis we take a close look at the correlation between income, and the days of games missed due to injuries. The last two slides provide a list of players with the highest and lowest number of games missed. Our findings indicate there are many
                    players with successful careers in spite of multiple injuries. A good example is Kevin Love, who has 82 days of games missed due to injuries, but has a long career (10 years of experience), and makes $28.9 million. </p>
